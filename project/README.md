# Solar System

This project was divided in four phases:

1. In the first, we had to set up a program capable of calculating the points for certain graphical primitives and storing them in files (generator), and another that read such files and animated their content in 3D.
2. In the next phase, we created the basic model for the Solar System, by storing the planets' information in an hierarchical fashion and drawing them.
3. In the third phase, we introduced VBOs in the motor, to make the rendering process much more efficient, and Bezier curves/patches to draw the planets' trajectories. Meanwhile in the generator, we implemented Catmull-Rom points to calculate the asteroid's trajectory and transformations to induce rotational and translational movements in the planets.
4. Finnaly, we introduced textures, through mip-mapping, and lighting, for which we had to calculate the objects' normals.

This assignment was developed in **Graphical Computation**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
